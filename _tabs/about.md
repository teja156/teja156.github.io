# Who am I?
My name is Teja Swaroop and I am a 22-year old cyber security enthusiast from India. I love computers in general and look forward to learn something new about them everyday. I also like making content on cool tech stuff (mostly ethical hacking and programming). You can check out my work -

# Work experience?
I am still in the final year of my Engineering degree (from VIT University, Chennai) and I have working experience as an Intern at [Nokia Solutions and Networks](https://www.nokia.com/networks/). I don't have a job now (and I'm also not interested in working corporate jobs), so I am a full-time learner and content creator for now.

# Why this website?
This is my personal website that is created to document things I newly learn. You gotta admit that the best way to learn something is to write a blog post about it - hence this blog.

`But what about your other blog?`

Well. The other blog is monetized, and this is not. This blog is solely to document the steps in my journey.
